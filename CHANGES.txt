  Thanks to Lucie Lejard for spotting this and for the patch.
  [raphael]

- Fixed the CommentWidget to not be inline-editable in Plone 3.0.
  [hannosch]

- Added two extension profiles: one called 'default' with everything except
  the demo types and another one called 'demotypes' for nothing but the
  demo types.

- Added the SmartEmailField/Widget from Johannes Wille.
  See the doc string in widget.smartemail.SmartEmailWidget
  for more. Thanks Johannes!

- reenabled the demo types but now controlled by a flag in the config file

- made the insane 'email' masking a bit less insane

- introduced a flag 'add_select' in 'getDisplyList' to control the addition
  of the null entry ('Select'). Defaults to True

- bugfix in the new i18n support (missing domain in widget)


0.8
---

- improved i18n support [Mike Gabriel]

- added 'comment' field (lets you include formattable narrative
  in edit forms)

- first draft of a 'remotetext' field (not yet working)
  (the idea is to have a field pull its text from a remote source
  but also to be able to customize the text if needed)

0.7.2
-----

- fixed bug when deleting more than one entry from a list of records
  using the records widget (thanks to Mike Gabriel for spotting the
  bug and to Frank Bennett for the fix)

0.7.1
-----

- fixed references to deprecated calendar_slot [David Siedband]

- extended Record.getVocabularyFor to accept the use of DisplayLists
  as subfield_vocabulary entries and to raise errors if a valid
  DisplayLists was not returned from an expression. [DWM]

0.7
---

- add the 'formattable name(s)' data types, fields, and widgets

0.6
---

- rearranged almost everything to be inline with AT-1.4's
  architecture

- made it backwards compatible with AT-1.2 again
  (hopefully)

- added postprocessing to the URL widget to supply http as
  default protocol if no-one is supplied.

0.5
---

- added ComboWidget and combo_widget.pt to create combo boxes
  where users can select a value or specify one freely
  it they select 'other'.

- added a 'delete' flag to each record in RecordsWidget's
  edit macro.

- added an optional 'maxlength' attribute for subfields

- added subfield validation; from now on AT 1.3 is required
  (I think)

- updated the demo type (WorkingGroup) to use subfield validation
  for the 'homepage' subfield in e-contact

0.4
---

- added a 'delete all entries' checkbox to the records widget

- added 'minimalSize' and 'maximalSize' to the RecordsField's
  properties to enable better control of the number of lines
  offered in the edit form

- do not override 'content_edit' anymore; configure the form
  controller on install instead and add a custom 'more_edit'
  to be called when 'more' is pressed (only slight extension
  to the original 'content_edit' but I couldn't get around
  otherwise with the references - thanks to Roche Compaan
  for a valuable hint).

- Record(s)Field should now work with schemata or portal_factory
  without the risk of data loss

- adapted the demo content type ('WorkingGroup') to reflect the
  above changes and made it demonstrate how to enable the
  date picker box for a DateTime subfield

- added support for 'int', 'long' and 'float' as subfield types
  in RecordField and RecordsField.

0.3
---

- made compliant with the new security policy for archetypes 1.3:
  Registered the UrlField/Widget and replaced 'getRaw' in the
  Record(s)Widget by an appropriate indirect call to the edit
  accessor.

0.2
---

- added a RecordsField and -Widget (records are a list of record objects)

- improved the RecordWidget's view macro (empty subfields are not rendered)
