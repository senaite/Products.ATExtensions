Welcome to ATExtensions
=======================

This package provides some further fields and widgets
for archetypes as used by Plone.

Most generic are the RecordField/Widget (effectively
handling a dictionary) and the RecordsField/Widget
(handling a list of records). The  most advanced
application thereof are the FormattableName(s) fields
and widgets.

To demonstrate their usage, there are demo content types 
called 'WorkingGroup' and 'FormattbleNameDemo' which
can be installed using the packages 'demotypes' profile.
To enable the types after install, go to portal types and 
make them implicitly addable or include 
them in some folderish type's 'allowed_content_types'.

ATExtensions are installable in the Plone 2.1, 2.5,
and 3.0 series.

Enjoy,
